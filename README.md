# Artificial-Intelligence

## Introduction to Artificial-Intelligence

**Artificial intelligence (AI)** refers to the ability of a machine to learn patterns and make predictions. AI does not replace human decisions; instead, AI adds value to human judgment. 

In short: artificial intelligence is a field that combines computer science and robust datasets to enable problem-solving.

AI plays an often invisible role in everyday life, powering search engines, product recommendations, and speech recognition systems.

The three levels of predictions that AI can make:

1. Narrow
2. Broad
3. General

## What is the difference between AI and augmented intelligence?

**Augmented intelligence** has a modest goal of helping humans with tasks that are not practical to do. For example, “reading” 1000 pages in an hour. 

Machines and humans both working together. and they are doing so to inhance each others's efforts when completing tasks.

**Artificial intelligence** has a lofty goal of mimicking human thinking and processes.

The ability for machines to perform tasks that normula required human intelligence such as reasoning natural communication and problem solving. it basically replaces the need for a human.
And the artificial intelligence performs certine tasks and makes decisions.

**Note:** AI today is not mature enough to perform independent tasks such as diagnosing cancer.

AI machines (AI services) do not think. They calculate

How do AI services calculate?

1. Analysis: AI services can take in (or “ingest”) enormous amounts of data. They can apply mathematical calculations in order to analyze data, sorting and organizing it in ways that would have been considered impossible only a few years ago.

2. Prediction: AI services can use their data analysis to make predictions. They can, in effect, say, “Based on this information, a certain thing will probably happen.”
