# Artificial-Intelligence

## Introduction to Artificial-Intelligence

**Artificial intelligence (AI)** refers to the ability of a machine to learn patterns and make predictions. AI does not replace human decisions; instead, AI adds value to human judgment. 

In short: artificial intelligence is a field that combines computer science and robust datasets to enable problem-solving.

AI plays an often invisible role in everyday life, powering search engines, product recommendations, and speech recognition systems.

The three levels of predictions that AI can make:

1. Narrow
2. Broad
3. General

## What is the difference between AI and augmented intelligence?

**Augmented intelligence** has a modest goal of helping humans with tasks that are not practical to do. For example, “reading” 1000 pages in an hour. 

Machines and humans both working together. and they are doing so to inhance each others's efforts when completing tasks.

**Artificial intelligence** has a lofty goal of mimicking human thinking and processes.

The ability for machines to perform tasks that normula required human intelligence such as reasoning natural communication and problem solving. it basically replaces the need for a human.
And the artificial intelligence performs certine tasks and makes decisions.

**Note:** AI today is not mature enough to perform independent tasks such as diagnosing cancer.

AI machines (AI services) do not think. They calculate
